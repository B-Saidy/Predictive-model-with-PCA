There is huge difference in accuracy between the initial and final models. R – squared value improved to 97.1% that is the final model explains 97.1% of the variance in the response variable. Also, the R – Square Adjusted jumped from 64.7% to 96.7% - it penalizes the R-squared based on the number of variables, but as in the case above the R-squared adjusted does not change much from the R-squared value-i.e. all predictors are contributing significantly to the model. In terms of loglikelihood, the initial model (-17.735) shows a relatively lower value than the final model (1.2553)- this gives an indication that the final model is a better fit for the data.  A similar pattern is shown by comparing the AIC value between the models. The final model shows a relatively low AIC which also is indicative of a better model.  Generally, the WLS model fits better with interaction terms pc1:pc2 and pc1:pc3 together with BoxCox transformed of the target variable.
